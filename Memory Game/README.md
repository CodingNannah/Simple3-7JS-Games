### What I changed:
* Christmas theme
* doubled the cards from 6 to 12 (24 cards to match)
* adjustments to card sizing with setAttribute
* background linear-gradient

### What I learned:
* "runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received" is usually caused by Chrome extensions - Alarm can be ignored; does not break the program
* sort algorithm shortcut for shuffling an array randomly with: cardArray.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random())

### Future Improvements:
* figure out how to have two or more images files that can be requested by drop-down/switched by button by the user, ennabling generic, seasonal, and holiday themes
* pop-up: "You found a match!"
* two player or choose computer vs. person
